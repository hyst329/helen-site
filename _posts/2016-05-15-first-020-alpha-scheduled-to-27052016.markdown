Hello again! After almost a month without news, here are some.
This time it's about the 0.2.0 release schedule. The first alpha
(`v0.2.0-alpha1`) is expected at 27.05, while the `0.2.0` final release
will be somewhere in June (between 10 and 30.06).

One of the new features in 0.2.0 will be *generics* (similar to templates in
C++). The type parameters will be in brackets, like here:

```
fun generic[T] test(T a, T b) -> T
    T c = a + b
    return c
endfun
```

(This is an example of generic function, and generic classes will have
similar syntax).

Stay tuned, I hope that more news will come in the nearest future.

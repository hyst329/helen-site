Welcome to the site of the Helen programming language.

Although the history of this languages dates back to January 2014, the language
concept and tools hadn't achieved the "mature" state until the beginning of 2016.
And now, this is the time for the site.

Remember that can download the sources and binaries (currently Windows-only)
on the [Github repository][github-repo] of this project.

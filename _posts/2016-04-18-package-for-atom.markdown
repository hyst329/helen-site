Hello again! Today is also a historic date for Helen --- an Atom package for
Helen developers is released for the first time (v0.1.0; the version numbering
should not be confused with the one of the language). The package is called
`language-helen` and located [here][atom-package]. As of now, the only thing
implemented is the syntax highlighting for Helen language; but such of Helmake,
as well as the abilities to build via `helmake` or generate a `helmkf` file
are planned for the next version.

If you get any issues using the package, don't hesitate to send them to Github
via built-in Atom mechanisms --- by doing this you help the whole community to
find and fix the bugs faster!
